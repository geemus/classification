dynamodb operations (especially delete/put) should be queue/worker based
  ? queue_classic

speed things up by caching an sts key (instead of getting a new one for EVERY request)

? provide for 'stats' or the like that will return overall total and totals per category

delete should query/delete keys for a particular user only (currently deletes everybodies tokens by destroying tables)

? change heroku-app to have x-staging and x-production for parity with hud
