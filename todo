push table string building down into ddb
  then change update_token_counts to use "__#{category}__" or something similar, instead of the table name

delete should query/delete keys for a particular user only (currently deletes everybodies tokens by destroying tables)

dynamodb operations (especially delete/put) should be queue/worker based

? change heroku-app to have x-staging and x-production for parity with hud
