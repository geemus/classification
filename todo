categories list should be in a separate table (META_TABLE perhaps?)
dynamodb operations (especially delete/put) should be queue/worker based

update get_probabability to better take into account proper item totals and multiple categories (see specific TODOs in file)

post /categories/category
  batch_get_item in lookups should paginate if unproccessed items is non-empty

? change heroku-app to have x-staging and x-production for parity with hud
